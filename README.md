#### Play tic tac toe at https://reactoe.netlify.app/.
## Spinning this up in your local environment
- Refer to the excellent [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/) to get React up and running on your local environment.
- No additional dependencies :)
- Fork this repo into a dedicated folder, navigate to that folder, and 'npm start' will open a browser window with the game.

## Why did I build this?
This project was inspired by a separate project (formAlly, which I'll post publicly soon) that uses React to dynamically render forms from JSON data, including fields which are to be rendered conditionally in reponse to another field's input.

I'd recently started learning React and it had been a loooong time since I used JavaScript in any meaningful way. I wanted to learn about managing state and how it might be useful in such an implementation, so I followed the excellent [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on the official React site. The claim that mastering all the elements of writing an in-browser game of tic tac toe will solidify React essentials feels accurate. It's a nicely written tutorial - and fun to make a simple game!
