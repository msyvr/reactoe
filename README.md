# Tic tac toe
## Spinning this up in your local environment
- Refer to the excellent [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/) to get React up and running on your local environment.
- No additional dependencies :)
- Fork this repo into a dedicated folder, navigate to that folder, and 'npm start' will open a browser window with the game.
## Notes
This project was inspired by a separate project (formAlly, which I'll post publicly soon) that aimed to use React to create dynamically rendered forms from JSON input, and where some fields were to be rendered conditionally.

I'd just started learning React and it had been a loooong time since I used JavaScript in any meaningful way. Managing state was giving me some trouble, so I followed the excellent [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on the official React site. They're not kidding when they state that mastering all the elements of writing this simple game will solidify React essentials!

I worked through each step from scratch, and now know my way around a React app and can handle state management. It's really fun to hack and get the instantaneous feedback that React's zippy responsiveness enables.
